# Suggested Agenda for 2021-03-12

## Agenda Items
1. Code merging process
1. Status update on P001 - P2SH
1. Hardware Wallet Integration - P002
1. Please have a look at https://hans-schmidt.github.io/mastering_ravencoin/opinions/Thoughts_about_moving_forward.html. 
   - Are there developers interested in setting up SIGs? The Electrum SIG has already been set up and started working on forming a workable Electrum base the works for RVN.
   - Which non-code things should the Foundation control and spend money on? Seeds? Websites?
   - Can someone put together a list of all the major Ravencoin-related websites & github accounts and who owns them or has control? What about social media accounts (Discord, Telegram, Reddit, etc) and who owns, controls, moderates them? Pst them on the Foundation website. The point of the exercise is transparency, not to gain control.
    - Should we fund someone a modest amount to go through the Discord helpdesk and put together & maintain an organized FAQ for noobs?
    - Should we fund someone a modest amount to keep Raven.wiki updated? Who owns that?
1. Transaction malleability. How do we correct? Be good to discuss options, or setup a special interest group around this.
1. Status on P003 (currently an issue here: https://github.com/RavencoinFoundation/ravencoinfoundation.github.io/issues)
1. Status on P004 (currently an issue here: https://github.com/RavencoinFoundation/ravencoinfoundation.github.io/issues)
1. A fully flushed docs for ravencoin would be great, started converting the filecoin docs one.  Help is appreciated as there are only so many minutes in the day (https://github.com/corviato1/ravencoin-docs) 
1. For restricted assets; why are they limited to ten, and can the number be increased for better utilization of the network?
1. Why on Raven Core 4.3.2.1 that Main Assets, SubAssets, and Restricted Assets are limited to 10 which it should be 21billion?
